This is strophe, our XMPP client library.

Our goals are:

    * usable quickly
    * well documented
    * reliable

== Build Instructions ==
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make

== Requirements ==

Libstrophe requires libresolv on UNIX systems. Make sure you include 
if you are compiling by hand.

It also uses expat for XML processing, but a current copy is included in the
expat/ directory of the SVN checkout

== Design ==

xmpp connection should be a FSM
